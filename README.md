This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project uses THREE.js combined with react-three-fiber to render the brain models.

Brain models were used from [Brain for blender](https://brainder.org/research/brain-for-blender/).
